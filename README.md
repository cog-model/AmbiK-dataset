# AmbiK: Dataset of Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment

The use of Large Language Models (LLMs), which demonstrate impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, in Embodied AI is a rapidly developing area. As a part of an embodied agent, LLMs are typically used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user. However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task ambiguity detection have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they are tested on different datasets, and there is no universal benchmark. For this reason, we propose **AmbiK** (**Ambi**guous Tasks in **K**itchen Environment), the fully textual dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human-validated. It comprises 500 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (Human Preferences, Common Sense Knowledge, Safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, user intents and task plans, for a total of 1000 tasks. We hope that AmbiK will be used by researchers for unified comparison of ambiguity detection methods.

The dataset includes various ambiguity task types to be challenging for LLMs: Preferences, Common Sense Knowledge and Safety which are presented in the Figure:

## AmbiK structure
AmbiK comprises 500 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (human preference, common sense knowledge, safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, and task plans. The full structure of the dataset with examples is presented in the table below.

**Start of ambiguity**        | a number of plan point where ambiguity starts (Python-like indexing, 0 for the first point of the plan) | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Every ambiguous task has its unambiguous counterpart, for instance, the task: *Kitchen Robot, please make a hot chocolate by using the coffee machine to heat up milk. Then pour it into **a mug**.* has an unambiguous pair:

*Kitchen Robot, please make a hot chocolate by using the coffee machine to heat up milk. Then pour it into **a ceramic mug**.* 

Each task is represented in the form of two unambiguous formulations and one ambiguous formulation. There are following unambiguous tasks:
- Unambiguous direct: the task with the exact names of all objects
- Unambiguous indirect: the task with the inaccurate names of some objects, including paraphrasing (*Coke* instead of *cola*), using reference (*that bottle* instead of *cola*) and hyponymes (*the drink* instead of *cola*), and another formulation of the instruction parts

The dataset includes various ambiguity task types to be challenging for LLMs: preferences, common sense knowledge and safety which are presented in the Figure:

## Repository structure:
- folder `ambik_dataset` contains .csv files with AmbiK data, `ambik_calibrate_100.csv` is calibration data, `ambik_test_400.csv` is data for testing ambiguity detection methods
- folder `configs` contains .yaml files, which should be edited for changing used LLMs and their parameters
- folder `utils` contains code for metrics calculations and LLM launching
- folders `knowno`, `lofree`, `LAP`, `binary`, `nohelp` contain code for running experiments of KnowNo, LofreeCP, LAP, Binary and NoHelp methods, correspondingly

##  Instructions for running experiments on the AmbiK dataset
1. If you plan to test LofreeCP method, download the `en_core_web_md` model: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_md`
2. Navigate to the root folder
3. For KnowNo, LofreeCP or LAP, run a script in the format `python3 <experiment folder>/calibrate.py`, for example,`python3 knowno/calibrate.py` for KnowNo. This script will perform calibration on 100 examples and output the conformal prediction value. Unsert the conformal prediction value into the code of `pipeline.py` in the experiment folder.
5. For any experiment, run a script in the format `python3 <experiment folder: knowno/lofree>/pipeline.py`. This script performs testing. Results (detailed intermediate and aggregated) will be saved in a new folder named `<CP value>_<LLM1>_<LLM2>` as .csv tables.
