# AmbiK: Dataset of Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment

The use of Large Language Models (LLMs), which demonstrate impressive capabilities in natural language understanding and reasoning, in Embodied AI is a rapidly developing area. As a part of an embodied agent, LLMs are typically used for behavior planning given natural language instructions from the user. However, dealing with ambiguous instructions in real-world environments remains a challenge for LLMs. Various methods for task disambiguation have been proposed. However, it is difficult to compare them because they work with different data. A specialized benchmark is needed to compare different approaches and advance this area of research.

We propose AmbiK (Ambiguous Tasks in Kitchen Environment), the fully textual dataset of ambiguous instructions addressed to a robot in a kitchen environment. AmbiK was collected with the assistance of LLMs and is human-validated. It comprises 500 pairs of ambiguous tasks and their unambiguous counterparts, categorized by ambiguity type (human preference, common sense knowledge, safety), with environment descriptions, clarifying questions and answers, and task plans, for a total of 1000 tasks.

**Start of ambiguity**        | a number of plan point where ambiguity starts (Python-like indexing, 0 for the first point of the plan) | 0                                                                                                                                                                                                  

Every ambiguous task has its unambiguous counterpart, for instance, the task: *Kitchen Robot, please make a hot chocolate by using the coffee machine to heat up milk. Then pour it into **a mug**.* has an unambiguous pair:

*Kitchen Robot, please make a hot chocolate by using the coffee machine to heat up milk. Then pour it into **a ceramic mug**.* 

Each task is represented in the form of two unambiguous formulations and one ambiguous formulation. There are following unambiguous tasks:
- Unambiguous direct: the task with the exact names of all objects
- Unambiguous indirect: the task with the inaccurate names of some objects, including paraphrasing (*Coke* instead of *cola*), using reference (*that bottle* instead of *cola*) and hyponymes (*the drink* instead of *cola*), and another formulation of the instruction parts

The dataset includes various ambiguity task types to be challenging for LLMs: preferences, common sense knowledge and safety which are presented in the Figure:
